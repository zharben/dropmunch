# dropmunch 
#     This program processes data file format specifications that are
#     dropped in the "specs" folder relative to the project root.
#
#     Based on available format specifications, data files dropped in
#     the "data" folder relative to the project root.
#
#
# First, please read INSTALL for instructions on dependencies 
# required to run dropmunch

#
# Assuming the required ubuntu and pip packages have been installed,
# the following steps are required to run dropmunch :
#
# 1) Set up the vagrant/postgres box - see vagrant/INSTALL
#    NOTE - password credentials for postgres are provided in plaintext.
#
# 2) Run database migrations :
#
#    # Remove all dropmunch schema changes
#    $ alembic downgrade base
#
#    # Execute all schema changes
#    $ alembic upgrade head
#
#    # These migrations can be run as many times as you wish.
#    # However, doing so means your precious dropmunch data
#    # will be destroyed.
#
# 3) Run unit tests from the "dropmunch/test"
#
#    test/test_munch_data.py
#    test/test_munch_spec.py
#
# 4) Run dropmunch:
#    bin/munch.sh -h

# Options:
#   -h --help
#   -v      verbose (log level INFO)
#   -V      more verbose (log level DEBUG). Warning - outputs DB credentials!
#   -c      import_log.num_rows_processed will be updated after EVERY row!
#           This allows dropmunch to recover from unexpected crashes to finish
#           processing files, however it will slow down processing
